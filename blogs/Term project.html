            <p class="data">The objective is to predict which passengers made it through the titanic ship crash. To predict that, a machine learning model is to be created. When you're prepared to compete, click the "Join Competition" button to register for an account and obtain access to the information related to the competition. Using input data that contains parameters like age, sex, fare we find the kind of
people most likely to survive the crash.

The given three datasets to predict survival is train.csv,test.csv and gender_submission.csv.

'Train.csv' includes information of travelers on the ship and their survival status. With respect to the filed 'Survived,' we determine individual survival status.
1-indicates that the passenger survived and 0-indicates that the passenger died.
                </p>
               <ul>
                <li>1-If survived</li>
                <li>..0-If not survived.</li>
               </ul>

               <p class="data">
'Test.csv' includes similar information as 'Train.csv' but does not contain the 'Survived' field, with the help of patterns from the training data, we predict the survival status on the 
rest of the passengers on the ship.

'gender_submission.csv' a sample for predictions.It indicates that every female traveler will live, while every male passenger will pass away.
But like this file, submission has the following: </p>
               <ul>
                <li>A field 'PassengerId' which holds the IDs of every traveler from 'test.csv'</li>
                <li>A field 'Survived' which gives a '1' and '0' for survived and not survived traveler respectively.</li>
               </ul>
