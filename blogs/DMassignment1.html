            <p class="heading2">The goal is to use https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions dataset and improve average accuracy of classification.
The task is to experiment with various hyper parameters by taking factors into consideration such as no of neurons per layer,number of layers and shape of conv2d,a barchart showing performace is created.</p>
               
            
               
               <h3 class="heading2"><u>Algorithm</u></h3>
               <p class="heading2">
               A convolutional neural network (CNN) has several hidden layers in addition to input and output layers. The convolutional layers that make up a CNN's hidden layers often convolve with a multiplication or other dot product. The activation function, which is frequently a REctified Linear Unit (RELU) layer, is followed by additional convolutions like pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers. These layers are referred to as hidden layers because the activation function and final convolution mask their inputs and outputs. Backpropagation is then frequently used in the last convolution to improve the final product's weight.
To recap, a CNN have
1. Convolutional Layers
2. Pooling Layers
3. Fully Connected Layers
4. Normalization Layers
where 2,3,4 are *hidden layers*.

                The challenge is during experimenting with hyperparameters.I took three cases for each given cases and plotted graph.
