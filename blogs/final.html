            <p class="heading2">The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle ( http://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushar5harma/topredditcomments). This dataset was chosen because it contains the data required for this project. It has top posts and comments files. The posts and comments were identified by post_id hence merged to obtain a single file that was use. Here are the columns of the dataset, post_id, comments, comment, subreddit, date, year. The project requires subreddit and comment columns for it’s implementation.</p>

               <p class="heading2">
                Naive Bayes is a straightforward method for building classifiers. These models assign class labels to problem cases, which are represented as vectors of feature values, and the class labels are chosen from a finite set. 
                A straightforward visual aid for classifying samples is a decision tree.A common technique in data mining is decision tree learning.[3] The objective is to build a model that uses a number of input variables to forecast the value of a target variable.

               <h3 class="heading2"><u>Contribution and Challenge</u></h3>
               <p class="heading2">
                As we aimed at improving the functioning of the algorithms, we used several algorithms to test their performance. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree classifier and KNN-nearest neighbors algorithms were used. And from the observation, Naïve Bayes had the best accuracy score out of the three. To keep the algorithm working properly and omit overfitting of the models, we introduced the pruning technique.
